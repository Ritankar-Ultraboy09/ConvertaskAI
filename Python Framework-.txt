Python Framework:-
1. Flask 
2. for UI (html+ css(Bootstrap)+ FontAwesome)

Database:-
1. Postgres Database through psycopg-binary

Transcription route
1. pydub package is used for conversion into .wav , converting into mono channel and frame rate into 16k hz as Faster-whisper needs
2. Faster-whisper medium model compute type 16, put into translation right now, for directly translating.
3. The transcription can be downloaded.
4. There are options provided in the UI which provides the summarisation gateway. It also has a additional prompt box where you can add any extra prompt for the same. 
5. We have also put a attachement button, where you can add additional attachements along with the transcript. 

the transcription is returned and the '/display transcirpt' route shows the transcript text 


Summarisation:-
1. The summarisation tool has been deployed under the name Convertask Ai tool, which summarises on the basis of the transcript that has beene generated. 
2. The model used is llama3:8b-instruct-qk-16K (Llama's quantization along with setting up custom token to 16348 ) as of now. 
3. The model is runned through ollama, which is containerized in docker, and deployed locally as localhost:11434.
4. For the summarisation route initially is given which , determines the LLM , regarding its role. Right now, it is being told it is a Strategic tool
5. We have also set a email route, which identifies any "send me this on email" command and send it to the person
6. We have also added a update to notion route, that updates tasks using the notion's API


Future:-
1. We need voice recogs
2. Ability to get trained on the basis of the basic needs of the company
3. All of this are future prospects which can be achieved using Fine tuning the model.
